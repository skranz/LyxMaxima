LyxMaxima
=========

An R based GUI for computer algebra with Lyx using Maxima


## Experimental, dirty and not well documented

Like RMaxima, LyxMaxima is an experimental project that has not grown out an early stage. While it usually runs on my computer, errors often occur. It does not try to implement a Latex parser, but uses a lot of string manipulation to convert Latex to Maxima or R code. This is quite dirty but works often (yet not always). Unfortunately, it is not well documented and currently, I don't actively work on it.


See ./inst/Vignette LyxMaxima.md for more details about the internal structure.
